# Note!
### This is a remake of my another project ( https://github.com/Ramazantk3/Product-Filtering-Website ), which I had made following a youtube tutorial. This project is uniquely made to showcase that I actually learned from the tutorial and didn't just copy the code. In order to make it as unique as possible I changed the context to my favorite movie character, Predators. Also, Plasma Caster filter works, it's just that every Predator has that weapon, but it didn't came into my mind at the time being that I started the project.

# What's Important In This Code?
- ### Styling is done by using Tailwind.css so there is no styles.css file but everything in the classes of html tags.
- ### This code contains advanced Javascript methods like forEach,map,trim,filter,document.createElement,appendChild,classList,contains and event listeners.
- ### This code contains DOM manipulation with JS.
- ### To change display, 'hidden' class of Tailwind.css added and removed.

# What's New In This Code That Also Important?
- ### Each Predator unlike original project has more than one category/weapon.
- ### I added a simple team/products page that's displayed when clicked on team icon which lists Predators/products in the team/cart.
